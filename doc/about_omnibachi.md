# About OmniBachi

**OmniBachi™ is the reference implementation of [Protocol-Governed Systems (PGS)](/blog/)** —
software whose behavior is separated from its execution mechanics.

> Where system intent becomes durable architecture — not technical debt.

## What is OmniBachi?

**Protocol-Governed Systems (PGS)** is the architecture: a discipline for defining,
validating, and executing application behavior through **explicit capability declarations**
rather than imperative business logic. **OmniBachi is the reference implementation** that
makes that architecture concrete.

Instead of embedding rules, flows, and policies in procedural code, OmniBachi treats them as
**structured protocol artifacts** — validated before execution, observed during execution,
and reasoned about after execution.

OmniBachi is not a framework, and not a workflow engine in the traditional sense. It is an
**execution model** for building systems whose behavior can be inspected, constrained, and
evolved without rewriting code.

## The architectural shift

### Traditional application development

Most modern applications express behavior through large bodies of imperative code. Even
simple system intent — user onboarding, account lifecycle changes, eligibility checks —
becomes scattered across services, conditionals, and glue logic.

As systems grow, behavior becomes implicit, correctness becomes probabilistic, and change
becomes increasingly risky. The result is not just technical debt, but **architectural
opacity**.

### The PGS approach

PGS treats system behavior as **declared intent**, expressed through protocols that
reference reusable capabilities. Rather than writing new logic for each scenario, systems
**compose existing capabilities** under explicit constraints. Execution follows validated
structure, not ad-hoc control flow.

This shifts complexity from *code paths* to *protocol design* — where it can be reviewed,
versioned, tested, and reasoned about. The goal is not fewer steps. **The goal is fewer
unknowns.**

## What this enables

### Structural scalability

Traditional systems scale by adding more code. PGS scales by **reusing structure**. As
systems grow, capabilities remain stable, protocols grow declaratively, and execution
behavior stays predictable — growth that is **compositional, not combinatorial**.

### Determinism by construction

Determinism is an architectural property, not a runtime feature: inputs are explicit, side
effects are declared, and execution paths are validated before runtime. If a protocol is
valid, execution is reproducible. If execution deviates, it is observable.

### Observability without instrumentation

Because behavior is declared structurally, observability does not depend on logging
discipline. Execution produces structured traces, capability-level metrics, and explicit
causal relationships. Visibility is a consequence of design, not an afterthought.

## What OmniBachi is *not*

### Not infrastructure automation

Tools like Terraform or Kubernetes define **infrastructure state**. OmniBachi defines
**application behavior** that runs *on* infrastructure — adjacent but fundamentally
different problems.

### Not a traditional workflow engine

Many workflow platforms still require imperative code, embedded logic, or platform-specific
execution models. OmniBachi does not optimize how workflows are written; it questions **why
behavior must be written as workflows at all**. Protocols are not scripts — they are
**contracts for execution**.

## Core principles

1. **Explicit declaration** — protocols describe *what must occur*, not *how it is
   implemented*. Implementation details remain interchangeable; intent does not.
2. **Deterministic execution** — given the same inputs and protocol version, execution
   produces the same observable outcomes. This is a design constraint, not a runtime
   feature.
3. **Structural reuse** — capabilities are designed once and reused everywhere. Behavior
   scales through composition, not duplication.

## System properties

- **Protocol-first validation** — structural correctness, capability compatibility, and
  side-effect constraints are checked before execution. Invalid intent never reaches
  runtime.
- **Domain neutrality** — the execution engine contains no domain knowledge; all domain
  behavior lives in protocols and capabilities. The same engine supports application
  backends, operational processes, regulated workflows, and long-lived enterprise systems.
- **Long-lived architecture** — designed for systems measured in decades, not release
  cycles. Protocols evolve, capabilities stabilize, execution remains inspectable.

## Current state

PGS has moved well beyond prototype. The reference implementation spans a multi-repo
ecosystem with a working **compiler** (admissibility construction and conformance
generation), a generic **runtime** execution engine, read-only **protocol inspection**
tooling, and a governed **change-management** pipeline. Ongoing work focuses on protocol
compilation and optimization, authoring and inspection tooling, and multi-environment
execution discipline. Details evolve; architectural direction does not.

## Why the name *OmniBachi*?

**Omni** — universal applicability. **Bachi** — protocol-driven structure. OmniBachi
reflects a belief that systems should be governed by **explicit structure**, not implicit
code paths — regardless of industry or domain.

## Vision

Traditional software asks how to manage complexity. PGS asks why complexity is implicit in
the first place. When intent is explicit, systems become understandable. When systems are
understandable, they become durable.

OmniBachi is not an optimization of existing practices. It is a **reframing of how
application behavior is expressed, validated, and trusted.**
