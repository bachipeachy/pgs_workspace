# Appendix A — Glossary of PGS Terms

This glossary defines the operational vocabulary of Protocol-Governed Systems. PGS vocabulary is structural, not descriptive — each term corresponds to a specific architectural role. Understanding these terms is understanding the system.

## Core Paradigm

**Protocol-Governed System (PGS)**  
A computational model in which system behavior is defined as compiled governance artifacts rather than as an emergent property of implementation code. All permissible behavior is declared before execution; only declared behavior is executable.

**Protocol Artifact**  
A declarative unit of behavior (Intent, Workflow, Capability Contract, etc.) that is authored, validated against governance invariants, and compiled into an execution structure. Artifacts are the law of the system — they define what is permitted, not what is implemented.

**Behavioral Admissibility**  
The property that a behavior has been declared, validated, and compiled into the execution graph. Only admissible behaviors can execute. Admissibility is determined at compile time, not at runtime.

**Correct-by-Construction**  
The property that execution correctness is established structurally, at compile time, rather than verified post-hoc. If the compiler accepts an artifact, the execution graph it produces cannot contain unauthorized paths.

**Semantic-Agnostic Execution**  
The property of the runtime engine: it traverses the compiled execution graph and dispatches capabilities without interpreting the meaning of domain operations. The engine does not know what "register an actor" means — it knows only structural prefixes (`CC_`, `CT_`, `CS_`) and declared routing outcomes.

**Generation-Governance Impedance Mismatch**  
The structural gap that arises when implementation velocity ($V_g$) exceeds governance velocity ($V_{gov}$). Conventional systems assume $V_g \leq V_{gov}$; AI-speed code generation makes $V_g \gg V_{gov}$. PGS resolves this by making governance compile-time rather than runtime.

**Governance Dividend**  
The long-term reduction in system complexity and cost-of-change achieved by constitutional constraint. As PGS systems grow, the marginal cost of adding new domains decreases. Conventional systems exhibit the opposite trend.

## The Lifecycle Axis (How Behavior is Constructed)

**Tooling Layer (L-TO)**  
The lifecycle phase in which governance artifacts are declared by domain authors. The tooling layer produces the source-of-truth protocol declarations that all downstream phases consume.

**Governance Layer (L-GO)**  
The lifecycle phase in which declared artifacts are validated against constitutional invariants. An artifact passes governance if and only if it satisfies all invariants. Governance determines admissibility — not runtime behavior.

**Compiler Layer (L-CP)**  
The lifecycle phase that transforms validated governance artifacts into a deterministic execution graph ($\mathcal{G}$). The compiler is a first-class architectural primitive — it constructs the reachability structure of the system. If a path is not constructed by the compiler, it cannot be traversed.

**Execution Layer (L-EX)**  
The lifecycle phase in which the compiled execution graph is traversed. The runtime is domain-agnostic; all domain logic is encoded in the graph, not in the engine.

**Structure Layer (L-ST)**  
The lifecycle phase responsible for canonical identity and FQDN resolution. Every artifact has a unique, stable identity independent of its physical location.

**Builder**  
The tooling implementation of the Compiler Layer. In OmniBachi, the builder is `pgs_compiler`'s compilation pipeline. It discovers artifacts, validates them, materializes compiled output into `protocol_snapshot/`, and produces a build manifest.

**Protocol Snapshot**  
The compiled, immutable output of the builder — a closed set of execution-ready artifacts. The runtime reads only the snapshot. The snapshot is read-only at runtime.

## The Execution Axis (What Behavior Does)

**Transport Ingress (TI)**  
Normalizes external input into canonical internal protocol representation. External callers do not send raw data to the execution engine — they send it through TI, which validates and transforms it.

**Actor Context (AC\_)**  
The authority principal of an execution. An AC\_ artifact binds identity, role, and permissions to an execution session. Code does not inherit authority from its environment — authority is established by AC\_ declarations.

**Intent (IN\_)**  
The admission gate for a workflow. An IN\_ artifact declares the admission rules: what payload shape is required, what actor context is permitted, and what workflow is triggered. If the intent is not satisfied, the workflow does not execute.

**Workflow (WF\_)**  
The execution graph definition. A WF\_ artifact declares the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of Capability Contracts: which nodes execute, in what order, and how outcomes route to subsequent nodes. The workflow is compiled into $\mathcal{G}$ by the builder.

**Capability Contract (CC\_)**  
A named node in the execution graph. A CC\_ artifact declares the node's input bindings (JSONPath expressions), its pipeline of CT\_ and CS\_ steps, and its outcome routing table. CC\_ is the interface — it does not implement behavior; it orchestrates declared capabilities.

**Capability Transform (CT\_)**  
A pure computational unit — deterministic, side-effect free. Given identical inputs, CT\_ always produces identical outputs. CT\_ atoms cannot write to storage, call external APIs, or mutate state. CT\_ is resolved to its implementation via an RB\_ binding.

**Capability Side Effect (CS\_)**  
A controlled interface to external state. CS\_ performs bounded mutations (registry writes, event appends, JSON updates, email delivery, cross-workflow invocation). Every CS\_ step is explicitly declared in a CC\_ pipeline, bound via RB\_, and recorded in the execution trace.

**Event (EV\_)**  
The observability and control plane. Events contribute to the immutable execution trace, enable cross-boundary signaling, and participate in governance decisions (admission control, execution halt). Observability is an active governance mechanism.

**Transport Egress (TE)**  
Projects internal execution results into the representation required by external callers. TE is the output boundary — internal state is not directly accessible outside the TE boundary.

**Runtime Binding (RB\_)**  
An orthogonal resolution artifact that maps both CT\_ and CS\_ capability codes to their concrete implementations. RB\_ is not an execution concern — it does not define behavior or orchestration. It enables the runtime to dispatch capabilities without knowing their implementations. The same binding mechanism applies symmetrically to all capability types. RB\_ provides execution mapping, not authority.

**Admissibility Graph ($\mathcal{G}$)**  
The deterministic, compiled set of all authorized execution paths. $\mathcal{G} = (V, E)$ where $V$ is the set of authorized nodes and $E$ is the set of authorized transitions. A path that does not exist in $\mathcal{G}$ cannot be traversed — by construction, not by policy enforcement.

**Execution Trace ($T_{\text{evidence}}$)**  
The immutable, append-only record of an execution. The trace captures every node transition, every capability invocation, every input and output, every outcome. The trace is the ground truth of what happened — it proves that execution followed an admissible path. Audit reads the trace, not the code.

## The Capability Surface

**CT Atom**  
The smallest unit of pure computation — a single-purpose, side-effect-free function. Atoms compose into molecules.

**CT Molecule**  
A declarative composition of CT atoms with explicit dataflow between steps. Molecules are compiled into CT-IR (Intermediate Representation) for uniform execution by the CT executor.

**CT-IR (Intermediate Representation)**  
The normalized execution format for capability transforms. The CT executor consumes CT-IR — it does not distinguish atoms from molecules at execution time.

**CS Runtime Type**  
The concrete storage or interaction class that fulfills a CS\_ capability. The current runtime types are: `RegistryRuntime`, `MutableJsonRuntime`, `AppendOnlyJsonlRuntime`, `SendEmailRuntime`, `WorkflowGatewayRuntime`, `NameRegistryRuntime`. The set is closed — extending it requires a runtime engine change.

* * *

## Identity and Structure

**FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)**  
The canonical identity format for all PGS artifacts: `domain::ARTIFACT_CODE`. Examples: `blockchain::WF_REGISTER_ACTOR_UNVERIFIED_V0`, `capability_transforms::CT_PURE_GENERATE_ID_V0`. FQDN is the stable identifier — artifact files, artifact references, and runtime dispatch all use FQDN.

**FQDN Tree**  
The structural registry of all domains and their artifact namespaces, declared in `STRUCTURE_DISCOVERY_V0`. The builder discovers artifacts by traversing the FQDN tree. Adding a domain requires registering it in the tree (Act I of domain construction).

**Version**  
The `_V0`, `_V1`, etc. suffix on all artifact codes. Versions are immutable — an artifact cannot be modified in place. Changes require a new version. Multiple versions coexist; references are always to a specific version. There is no "latest."

## Security Properties

**Security Inversion Principle**  
Security is achieved by restricting the space of constructible behaviors, not by constraining execution of arbitrary behavior. Unauthorized behavior is not prevented at runtime — it is never constructed.

**Ambient Authority**  
Authority derived implicitly from an execution environment (e.g., a process running with database write access). PGS eliminates ambient authority: code has no inherent authority; all authority originates from $(AC, IN, WF, CC)$ declarations.

**Bounded Mutation Surface**  
The enumerable set of all state-change operations in the system: $|\text{CS\_}| + |\text{AC\_}| + |\text{RB\_}|$. No mutation can occur outside this surface by construction.

**Vocabulary Closure Invariant**  
No behavior may occur outside the declared concern vocabulary ($V$). All behavior must originate from protocol artifacts and be routable through known execution concerns. Behavior not expressible in $V$ cannot be compiled and therefore cannot execute.

**Implementation Blindness**  
The property that implementations cannot access each other or alter execution structure. All interaction between capabilities is mediated through protocol-defined pathways. A CT atom cannot call a CS operation directly.

**Structural Purity**  
The guarantee that CT\_ transforms are free of side effects — enforced structurally, not by language semantics. Even an impure implementation inside a CT\_ atom cannot produce side effects observable outside its declared outputs.

**Referential Persistence of Governance**  
Governance survives the temporal decay of implementation. Even if the code responsible for an action is regenerated, deleted, or replaced, the governance relationship — recorded in the execution trace and declared in the protocol artifacts — remains persistent, enforceable, and auditable.

## Domain Construction

**Domain**  
A coherent set of protocol artifacts (workflows, capability contracts, actors, events, intents) that express a bounded business or technical concern. Domains compose through federation, not modification.

**Act 0 (Domain Specification)**  
The pre-construction architectural design phase. Produces the domain specification: business thesis, actor inventory, workflow inventory, capability surface, invariants, and success criteria. All downstream acts implement what Act 0 specifies.

**Seven Architectural Acts**  
The construction method for a PGS domain, as described in Chapter 13:
- Act I: Register the domain namespace
- Act II: Author governance artifacts  
- Act III: Validate against invariants
- Act IV: Compile the protocol snapshot
- Act V: Wire capability implementations via RB\_ bindings
- Act VI: Execute with test payloads
- Act VII: Verify traces and lock down

**Compositional Isolation**  
The property that adding a new domain does not modify any prior domain's artifacts, engine code, or test outcomes. New domains are consumers of the platform, not contaminants of it.

**Declarative Federation**  
The mechanism by which multiple domains coexist without coupling: each domain registers in the FQDN tree, the builder discovers all domains at compilation time, and execution routes by FQDN without domain-specific logic.
