## What This Manual Is

This is a high-density architectural restoration artifact. Its purpose is to restore the correct architectural mental model of Protocol-Governed Systems in under 30 minutes — not to teach, not to document implementation, not to walk code.

**Intended for:** system architects, compiler engineers, runtime engineers, governance engineers, AI coding agents operating under human supervision, security reviewers, technical maintainers.

**Not a tutorial.** Assumes PGS familiarity. Source code, constitutions, invariants, and protocol artifacts remain authoritative. This manual restores the mental model needed to read them correctly.

**AI coding agent operating constraint.** PGS contains constraints that general-purpose coding agents violate unintentionally. Without architectural restoration, agents tend to introduce convenience abstractions, collapse governance boundaries, embed domain logic into runtime layers, add fallback behavior, and weaken determinism. The nine constraints below are non-negotiable before any substantial modification:

```
no fallback logic          no runtime discovery       no dynamic imports
no heuristic resolution    no ambient authority       no runtime topology synthesis
no short-name artifacts    compile-time governance    strict layer separation
```

**Architectural reading rule.** When ambiguity exists — governance overrides implementation convenience. This single rule resolves most architectural decisions correctly.

**PGS is not:** workflow orchestration with governance wrappers · a policy engine · a runtime authorization framework · a service mesh · a BPM engine.

**PGS is:** compile-time admissible execution construction.

| Step | Statement |
|------|-----------|
| **Protocol declares.** | What may exist and how it may execute — workflow topologies, capability contracts, governance rules. |
| **Compiler validates.** | What is admissible enters the snapshot. What is not admissible is rejected at build time — it cannot be expressed, so it cannot execute. |
| **Snapshot seals.** | Compiled, attested, immutable. The runtime's only input. Never modified by hand. Never modified at runtime. |
| **Runtime executes.** | Traverses the snapshot faithfully. Contains no domain knowledge. The same engine runs blockchain, AI governance, and any future domain identically. |
| **Trace proves.** | Append-only execution evidence. Deterministic. Substrate-neutral. If an action does not appear in the trace, it is architecturally prohibited. |

Three invariants that follow directly:

> The runtime does not decide what may exist. The compiler already decided.
> The runtime does not interpret behavior. The protocol already declared it.
> The compiler does not execute. The runtime executes only what the compiler sealed.

**The mantra:**

> Governance defines. Compiler constructs. Snapshot seals. Runtime executes. Trace proves.

**The nine execution concerns:**

| Prefix | Name | One-Line Role |
|--------|------|---------------|
| `TI_` | Transport Ingress | Normalizes external input to canonical internal form |
| `AC_` | Actor Context | Binds execution authority context |
| `IN_` | Intent | Admission gate — ACK or NACK before any traversal begins |
| `WF_` | Workflow | The topology — which CCs execute in what declared sequence |
| `CC_` | Capability Contract | Named DAG node — drives CT/CS pipeline, declares outcome |
| `CT_` | Capability Transform | Pure computation — zero side effects |
| `CS_` | Capability Side Effect | Controlled external state interaction — enumerated, bounded |
| `EV_` | Event | Governance signaling — emitted as declared values |
| `TE_` | Transport Egress | Projects internal result to external form |
| `RB_` | Runtime Binding | Maps declarations to implementations (not authority) |

## 0. Executive Doctrine

**One-line summary:** Behavior is a compiled artifact of protocol declarations — not an emergent property of implementation code.

| Principle | Statement |
|-----------|-----------|
| Protocol Sovereignty | Protocol is the sole source of behavioral truth |
| Runtime Dumbness | The runtime has zero domain or business logic knowledge |
| Compile-Time Resolution | All behavior determined and validated before execution |
| Zero Inference | Nothing is assumed, guessed, or defaulted |
| Fail Hard | No fallback, no recovery, no silent failure |
| Declaration Over Refactor | Change behavior by changing declarations, not code |
| Governance Before Execution | Protocol is law; execution is enforcement; trace is proof |
| Determinism | Identical inputs → identical traces, always |
| Security by Construction | Unauthorized behavior is never constructed, not merely blocked |
| Orthogonality | Governance surfaces evolve independently; coupling between surfaces is a violation |
| Snapshot Sovereignty | Runtime executes compiled state exclusively; no live modification |

---

## 1. Core Doctrine

### 1.1 Protocol is the Source of Truth
- Behavior identity is carried by protocol artifacts, not code
- Business logic is encoded in protocol artifacts, not in implementation code
- Code may be regenerated, replaced, or machine-authored; governance remains stable
- Behavioral authority persists independently of implementation lifecycle

### 1.2 Runtime Dumbness (Semantic-Agnostic Execution)
- The runtime enforces graph structure — it does not interpret domain meaning
- Same execution engine runs blockchain, AI governance, and collatz conjecture identically
- No domain logic is permitted in the runtime layer

### 1.3 Compile-Time Resolution
- Execution graphs are constructed before any runtime begins
- Behavioral admissibility is determined at compile time, not runtime
- If the compiler does not construct the path, the implementation cannot traverse it

### 1.4 Zero Inference
- No implicit defaults, no heuristics, no filesystem scanning
- All artifact locations must be declared explicitly
- No `../` traversal, no `cwd()`, no environment sniffing

### 1.5 Fail Hard
- Missing artifact → hard failure, not silent skip
- Constraint violation → reject, not log-and-continue
- No graceful degradation that masks architectural violations

### 1.6 Deterministic Execution
- Execution is a pure function: `Φ(G, input, actor_context) → (result, trace)`
- Replay is structural, not reconstructed

### 1.7 Governance Before Execution
- Constitutions define what is admissible
- Compiler validates — only conformant behavior enters the snapshot
- Runtime enforces — only snapshot behavior executes

### 1.8 No Ambient Authority
- Code has no inherent authority derived from its execution context
- All authority originates exclusively from protocol declarations: (AC, IN, WF, CC)
- An operation has exactly the authority declared in its artifacts — no more
- Confused deputy attacks are structurally eliminated, not defended against

### 1.9 Snapshot Sovereignty
- Runtime executes compiled snapshot state exclusively
- Snapshot is immutable during execution — no live modification
- Runtime behavior cannot diverge from compiled admissibility state
- To change behavior: change protocol source → recompile → rebuild snapshot

### 1.10 Architectural Compression
- PGS intentionally compresses architecture into a small number of explicit executable concerns
- A smaller ontology with stronger invariants is preferred over a larger ontology with heuristic flexibility
- This reduces governance ambiguity, hidden behavioral surfaces, cognitive reconstruction cost, and AI-agent violation probability
- The closed set of nine execution concerns and five governance surfaces is a feature, not a limitation
- Expanding ontology size without governance necessity is treated as architectural debt

---

## 2. Architectural Ontology

### 2.1 The Nine Execution Concerns

| Prefix | Name | Role | Group |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| `TI_` | Transport Ingress | Normalizes external input → canonical internal form | Boundary |
| `AC_` | Actor Context | Binds execution authority context; establishes admissible principal identity | Authority |
| `IN_` | Intent | Declarative admission gate; validates payload before graph traversal | Authority |
| `WF_` | Workflow | Declarative execution topology graph; compile-time governed traversal; determines admissible step sequences | Authority |
| `CC_` | Capability Contract | Named DAG node; declares inputs, outputs, routing outcomes | Capability |
| `CT_` | Capability Transform | Pure computation; deterministic; zero side effects | Capability |
| `CS_` | Capability Side Effect | Controlled external state interaction; enumerated, bounded | Capability |
| `EV_` | Event | Control plane + observability; governance signaling; active, not passive | Observation |
| `TE_` | Transport Egress | Boundary projection only; formats internal results for external systems | Boundary |

**Orthogonal Resolution:**

| Prefix | Name | Role |
|--------|------|------|
| `RB_` | Runtime Binding | Maps CT_ and CS_ declarations to concrete implementations; provides execution mapping, not authority |

### 2.2 Governance Constructs

| Construct | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Constitution | Defines invariants for an artifact domain |
| Invariant | Structural law enforced at compile time |
| Assertion | Specific check instantiated from an invariant |
| STRUCTURE | Compiler build configuration; governs scope of compilation |
| FQDN | `domain::ARTIFACT_CODE_Vn` — canonical artifact identity; no short names |
| Snapshot | Sealed, read-only compiled output; the runtime's only input |
| Federation Boundary | Declares a distinct semantic governance authority in `pgs_governance/registry/FB_*/`; one sovereign boundary (FB_CONSTITUTION), all others delegated |

**Version immutability:** Versions are immutable. There is no "latest." A change to behavior requires a new version number (`_V1`, `_V2`, etc.) — the old version remains valid and unchanged in the snapshot.

### 2.3 Governance Surfaces

PGS has five orthogonal governance surfaces. Each governs a distinct concern. They evolve independently — adding governance sophistication to one surface does not couple to any other. New governance surfaces may be added as long as the separation-of-concerns principle is not violated by design.

| Governance Surface | Governs |
|--------------------|---------|
| **Identity** | What entities ARE — actor declaration, FQDN, artifact identity |
| **Authority** | What entities MAY DO — admissibility, role grants, admission gates |
| **Execution Topology** | Admissible traversal — which capabilities execute in what declared sequence; immutable after compilation |
| **Execution** | Computation and side-effect semantics — CT purity, CS boundary, output contracts |
| **Boundary** | Admission and projection — TI normalization, TE rendering, transport orthogonality |

**Key invariant:** Governance surfaces are orthogonal planes. Topology governs traversal structure only. Authority governs eligibility only. Neither governs the other. Execution is semantically blind to both.

### 2.4 Artifact Code Prefixes

| Prefix | Meaning | Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| `WF_` | Workflow | `CC_` | Capability Contract |
| `CT_` | Capability Transform | `CS_` | Capability Side Effect |
| `IN_` | Intent | `RB_` | Runtime Binding |
| `EV_` | Event | `AC_` | Actor Context |
| `TI_` | Transport Ingress | `TE_` | Transport Egress |
| `STRUCTURE_` | Build configuration | | |

---

## 3. Governance Model

### 3.1 Constitutions
- Each artifact family governed by a constitution
- Constitution declares invariants that all artifacts of that type must satisfy
- Violation → compiler rejects the artifact; it never enters the snapshot

### 3.2 Invariants
- Structural laws applied at compile time
- Examples: FQDN identity required, no undeclared outcomes, no missing bindings
- Invariants are not advisory — violations are hard failures

### 3.3 Assertions
- Specific checks instantiated from invariants
- Registered in handler registry; resolved at compile time
- Static imports only — no dynamic loading of assertion handlers

### 3.4 Protocol Surface Closure (Vocabulary Closure Invariant)
- `Executable Behavior ⊆ Expressible in V` (the declared concern vocabulary)
- Behavior not expressible in V cannot pass governance, cannot enter snapshot, cannot execute
- This is a construction-time property, not a runtime guard

### 3.5 Governance Dividend

**Named Property:** As governance surface matures, cost-of-change decreases rather than increases.

- Conventional: low initial governance cost → debt accumulates → per-change cost grows unboundedly
- PGS: higher initial governance cost → debt does not accumulate → per-change cost remains stable
- Complexity: `O(N + M)` vs conventional `O(N × M)` where N = capabilities, M = workflows
- Attack surface: `|CS_| + |AC_| + |RB_|` — finite and enumerable

PGS separates implementation authorship from behavioral admissibility. Behavioral admissibility remains compiler-governed regardless of whether implementation is human-authored or machine-authored. AI may generate implementation, transforms, and workflow proposals — but AI does not define admissibility. Governance defines admissibility. Compiler constructs it. Runtime enforces it. Trace proves it.

### 3.6 Federation Boundaries

The governance registry is organized into **federation boundaries** — named semantic governance authorities, not filesystem folders.

**Current boundary inventory:**

| Boundary | Level | Governance Scope |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| `FB_CONSTITUTION` | **Sovereign** | Root protocol semantics, governance meta-rules, artifact identity, FQDN |
| `FB_TOPOLOGY` | Delegated | Execution topology, WF/CC legality, CT/CS surface closure, routing, binding |
| `FB_TRANSPORT` | Delegated | Ingress/egress semantics, transport boundary rules, admission |
| `FB_AUTHORITY` | Delegated | Actor authority, execution admissibility, authority state |
| `FB_VOCABULARY` | Delegated | Protocol terminology, execution state vocabulary |
| `FB_CONFORMANCE` | Delegated | Test data, conformance assertion rules |
| `FB_IDENTITY` | Delegated | Actor identity semantics, identity/authority separation |
| `FB_BLOCKCHAIN` | Delegated | Blockchain domain build configuration |
| `FB_AI_GOVERNANCE` | Delegated | AI governance domain build configuration |
| `FB_EXECUTION_SCHEDULING` | Delegated | Parallelism, synchronization, deterministic joins |
| `FB_EXECUTION_PLACEMENT` | Delegated | Execution locality, substrate placement, runtime deployment admissibility |
| `FB_SECURITY_DOMAIN` | Delegated | Classification domains, compartmentalization, secure information-flow legality |
| `FB_CRYPTOGRAPHIC_TRUST` | Delegated | Snapshot signing, attestation, encryption, trust admissibility |
| `FB_CHANGE_MGMT` | Delegated | Governed evolution — the change-management pipeline, dossier lifecycle, stage purity, gates (§4) |

**FQDN namespace:** All governance artifacts use `fb.<boundary_lower>::ARTIFACT_CODE` format.

```
fb.constitution::CONSTITUTION_FEDERATION_BOUNDARY_V0
fb.topology::CONSTITUTION_EXECUTION_TOPOLOGY_V0
fb.constitution::STRUCTURE_BUILD_PLATFORM_CONFIG_V0
```

**Sovereignty model:** Exactly one sovereign boundary (FB_CONSTITUTION). All others are delegated. A second sovereign boundary is a constitutional violation.

**Governance locality doctrine:** A governance artifact belongs in `pgs_governance` (central) if and only if it governs all PGS systems universally. Domain-specific governance law belongs in the domain repository.

**Anti-sprawl rule:** Federation boundaries must not be created to mirror organizational structure, repository topology, or implementation convenience. A boundary exists only when a distinct semantic governance authority exists.

**Authoritative doctrine artifact:** `fb.constitution::CONSTITUTION_FEDERATION_BOUNDARY_V0`

---

## 4. Authoring Model — Governed Evolution (Change Management)

**One-line summary:** Evolution is itself a governed protocol concern — every protocol change travels a governed **lifecycle** from Change Request through Authoring, Construction, Admission, Execution Validation, and Promotion, leaving a complete evidence chain (the dossier). The Authoring Mandate is a milestone in that lifecycle, not its end.

**Governing boundary:** `FB_CHANGE_MGMT` (delegated, in `pgs_governance/registry/`). **Implementation:** `pgs_change_mgmt` repo — stage templates in `change_mgmt/templates/`, dossiers in `change_mgmt/dossiers/<domain>/<subdomain>/`, lifecycle engine in `pgs_change_mgmt/engine/` fronted by one CLI, `pgs_change` (§4.11).

**The closing of the loop:** PGS governs construction (compiler) and execution (runtime). The change pipeline governs change itself. If the Protocol Snapshot does not change, the system is invariant by definition — the loop closes only when a new snapshot is **admitted, execution-validated, promoted into the owning source registries, and recompiled to VALID**. Change-management output is not code; it is an **admitted protocol delta** whose promotion the compiler gates.

### 4.1 The Pipeline (one CR = one dossier)

| Stage | Artifact | Answers | Key Rule |
|-------|----------|---------|----------|
| 1 | `change_request_<sub>_v0.md` | Classification + Problem · Outcome · Known Facts · Deferrals | Business language only; baseline claims verified against snapshot, never memory |
| 2 | `domain_model_<sub>_v0.md` | Entities · Processes · Baseline fit · Gaps | Record what was *searched*, not only what was found |
| 3 | `analysis_loop_<sub>_v0.md` | Gap resolutions, iterated to Discovery Saturation | Every answer carries evidence; overturned answers are marked, never erased |
| 4 | `business_model_<sub>_v0.md` | Canonical consolidation (all downstream stages project from this) | Consolidation, not re-litigation |
| 4b | (Section 7 of BM) | Authoring Scope: IN this CR vs deferred | Not listed = not built |
| 5 | `business_intent_<sub>_v0.md` | WHAT — behavior, objects, identity, invariants, actions | Provisional capability names OK; no bindings/paths |
| 6 | `governance_intent_<sub>_v0.md` | WHERE — domain/subdomain, ownership, dependencies | No new artifact codes; cross-subdomain writes forbidden |
| 6b | `design_intent_<sub>_v0.md` | HOW — FQDNs, topology, schemas, stores, module paths, RBs | **Gate 1 — Design Approval** (full dossier reviewed as a body) |
| 7 | `authoring_mandate_<sub>_v0.md` | IN WHAT ORDER — topologically sorted build waves | Mechanical derivation; must reconcile with 6b exactly. **Gate 2 — Mandate Approval** (dossier locked) |
| 8 | `build_sheet_<sub>_v0.md` | Construction projection — governed design assembled into a per-artifact Build Sheet Set (no new design) | Assembled not authored; governed by `CONSTITUTION_CONSTRUCTION_V0` |
| 9 | `construction_record_<sub>_v0.md` | Construction evidence: built artifacts, compiler/runtime results, deviations, discoveries | Evidence only; CR closes after the Record is complete and artifacts compile clean |

Every dossier stage (1–7) is a **structured register document**: the actor emits register rows, a deterministic renderer owns the document, and a **structural oracle** validates it mechanically (well-formed FQDNs, controlled vocabularies, per-row traceability, cross-stage code reconciliation) before human review. The **design/authoring pipeline (Stages 1–7)** ends at Stage 7. Everything after Gate 2 — Stage 8 Build Sheet Set → **construct** → **admit** → **execution-validate** → **promote** → Stage 9 Construction Record — is a *distinct governance authority*, governed by `fb.change_mgmt::CONSTITUTION_CONSTRUCTION_V0` (rationale: `pgs_change_mgmt/doc/CONSTRUCTION_MODEL_V0.md`). Design is open and human-gated; construction is non-authorial transcription in which the builder decides nothing. The dossier stages (1–9) are the *authored artifacts*; the **lifecycle states** below are the *governed status* a change passes through — a separate axis (§4.1a).

**Discovery Saturation (Stage 3 stop condition)** — all three simultaneously: no unresolved CRITICAL gaps · no open analyst questions · no dependency expansion in the last pass.

### 4.1a Lifecycle States — the status axis

The dossier stages record *what was authored*; the lifecycle records *how far the change has travelled toward a promoted snapshot*. A change is never "done" because a document exists — it is done when it reaches `PROMOTED` and the recompiled snapshot is VALID. Each transition is gated and emits evidence that lives **outside** the read-only snapshot.

```
DRAFT ──author (S1–S7)──▶ (mandate locked, Gate 2)
      ──construct (S8)──▶ CONSTRUCTION_COMPLETE   design lowered to a candidate protocol delta
      ──admit───────────▶ ADMITTED_UNVALIDATED    Compilation Unit compiles; impls may not yet exist
      ──validate────────▶ EXECUTION_VALIDATED      CR's acceptance scenario runs + observes = PASS
      ──promote (S9)────▶ PROMOTED                 delta copied to owning registries; compiler is the gate
```

| State | Reached by | Gate to leave it | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|------------------|----------|
| `DRAFT` | opening a CR | Gate 1 (Design) · Gate 2 (Mandate) — human-closed | the dossier (Stages 1–7) |
| `CONSTRUCTION_COMPLETE` | `construct` (build) | Construction-Completeness: zero gap census | Build Sheet Set + `cr_ir/` |
| `ADMITTED_UNVALIDATED` | `construct` (admit) | Admission: the **Compilation Unit** (Baseline ∪ Generated Delta ∪ Supplementary) compiles clean | `placement_manifest.json`, `governance_impact.json` |
| `EXECUTION_VALIDATED` | `validate` | Execution Validation: the CR's declared `acceptance_scenario` executes and every observation matches | `validation_report.json` |
| `PROMOTED` | `promote --confirm` | the compiler admits the promoted registries (rollback-all-on-red) | `promotion_report.json` |

**Admission is a first-class stage, distinct from execution.** A change can be *admissible* (its protocol delta compiles) long before its CT/CS implementations exist — that snapshot is marked `ADMITTED_UNVALIDATED`, never `VALID`. Admission proves **Protocol Completeness**; Execution Validation proves the behaviour actually runs. Conflating the two is the classic "it compiles, ship it" error the lifecycle refuses to make.

### 4.2 Purity Ladder

Each stage admits exactly one more vocabulary class. Exception at every rung: artifacts that already exist in the baseline may be cited by exact FQDN as evidence — citing the baseline is observation, not design.

```
Stages 1–4   business language only (nothing new gets a code)
Stage 5      + provisional capability names (IN/WF/CC vocabulary, unbound)
Stage 6      + placement (WHERE) — still no new codes
Stage 6b     + binding FQDNs, topology, schemas, stores
Stage 7      + build order
```

### 4.3 Elicitation Contract + Stage Execution Rules

Every stage template opens with **questions for the human, each paired with declared intent** (how the answer will be used). Unanswered question = open gap, never license to assume. The human supplies governed knowledge; the agent structures, verifies, and projects it.

Every stage carries **execution rules** — accumulated failure knowledge folded back from completed CRs:

| Rule | Origin |
|------|--------|
| Verify every baseline claim by reading the snapshot — never from memory | Agents trust recall; recall is stale |
| Search the inventory before authoring any new EV_/CT_/CC_ | Needed artifacts often already exist (e.g., an event reserved for exactly the CR at hand) |
| EV_ records facts; it never triggers execution — workflow chaining is a gateway CC | Event-subscription designs cannot compile or run |
| WF nodes are IN / CC / EXIT only — a WF never appears inside a WF | Sub-workflow invocation = `CC_INVOKE_*` on `CS_WORKFLOW_GATEWAY_V0` |
| A store is written only by its owning subdomain's CCs | Peer-store writes = dependency-gap CC owned by the peer, triggered by the CR |
| All codes carry `_V<n>`; counts reconcile across 6b/7 | Unversioned codes and drifting counts are defects |

### 4.4 Canonical Documentation Set (the change agent's oracle)

Complete, implementation-free context for any change agent — human or automated:

```
1. Protocol Snapshot   what the system currently does (runtime-executable)
2. PPS Snapshot        full compiled inventory (pps_snapshot/index.json) — check before authoring
3. Field Manual        this document — operational doctrine
4. Concept Papers      architectural rationale (why)
+ the dossier built so far
```

Agent context is declared in `pgs_change_mgmt/change_mgmt/templates/0_agent_context_template_v0.md` — the reading assignment loaded at CR start alongside `1_change_request_template_v0.md`; extend awareness by adding rows, not code.

### 4.5 Governance Dividend in Practice

Each cycle's manifest carries methodology lessons forward into the stage templates. Templates are the accumulation vehicle: every future CR (and agent) inherits prior failures as enforced rules, not folklore. Seven CRs executed to date (consensus_pos · block · data_model · consensus_propose · mempool · orchestration · chain) — the conceptual model is documented in the change-management concept paper (fifth in the series).

### 4.6 Authoring Protocol — Machine-Block Artifacts

When the change agent (human or automated) authors a machine-block artifact (CC / WF / IN / RB / CT / CS / STRUCTURE), three rules govern *how*:

- **Structured Contract → Renderer.** The agent emits a validated **structured contract object**, never free-form machine syntax; a deterministic renderer converts that object into the artifact's machine block. Free-form machine-syntax authoring is non-conformant — the experiment showed the representation, not the model, was the ceiling. (Reference impl: `contract_renderer.py`.)
- **Generate, Never Patch (b′).** The agent *generates* an artifact from the mandate; it never patches an existing one. On compiler rejection it regenerates fresh from the mandate plus the compiler diagnostics — diagnostics are context, not a diff to apply. Artifacts are disposable output; the **mandate is authoritative**. Authority stays upstream.
- **Agent Role.** The agent drafts; `pi` and the compiler govern; the human approves and commits. The worker is replaceable and authority never resides in it — this is what makes `COMPILER_VALIDATED_CLOSURE` (change-mgmt constitution §3) sound: artifacts are correct only when the compiler admits them, human review advisory.
- **Authority Invariance.** The pipeline is *authority-invariant with respect to the authoring actor* — the same templates, projection contracts, structural oracle, and compiler rules govern a human, a local model, or a frontier model identically (shown empirically by running one CR under Qwen 3.5 and Claude Opus 4.8 against an identical governance scaffold: drafts and convergence differed, governance did not). The actor possesses **no governing authority**: it cannot unilaterally alter governed state and cannot admit a change — only the compiler admits, only the oracle clears a stage, only a human closes a gate. *The actor proposes; governance disposes.* Authoring is interchangeable; authority is not.

### 4.7 Evaluation Doctrine — Judging Authored Output

How authored output (and the agent producing it) is judged is itself governed — the evaluator is not exempt from rigor:

- **Identity-Preserving Taxonomy.** Classify every artifact reference by resolving its identity against `artifact_index/index.json` before judging: **A** exact · **B** typo-alias · **C** wrong-domain · **D** proposed-new · **E** fabrication. Only **E** (no identity anywhere) is a hallucination; A–D all preserve identity. Aggregate not-found counts are inadmissible — they over-flag legitimate new-design FQDNs. (Reference impl: `grounding_audit.py`; mirrors constitution rule `IDENTITY_PRESERVING_REFERENCE_VALIDATION`.)
- **Trace Beats Aggregates.** A load-bearing claim requires end-to-end artifact-identity tracing. Aggregate counts, query tallies, and regex matches are insufficient evidence for any conclusion doctrine will rest on.
- **System Boundary.** The harness and the evaluator are part of the system under test. Distinguish **worker** vs **harness** vs **evaluator** variation before attributing a finding — e.g. ollama silently front-truncating at the ~4k default `num_ctx` is a harness fault, not a worker failure. Never encode worker-specific traits (verbosity, discovery depth, run-to-run variance) as doctrine — see *Research Classification* below.

### 4.8 Authoring Transports — the Trifecta

The actor-invariance of §4.6 is realized as **three interchangeable transports over one worker interface** (`execute_stage(StageInput) → StageOutput`). Only the transport between stage-prompt and worker differs; validation, handoff, gates, and figure-of-merit are identical.

| Transport | Worker | How |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| **Automated** | a model (local or frontier) | drives the stage in a tool-loop, grounding via `pi` |
| **Guided** | a human — or Claude Code, a *grounding-capable* worker with `pi`/Bash in-session | export a governed **Stage Package** (`run_interactive --export`), paste the reply into `response.md`, `--import`; the engine ingress-validates at the **Human Mutation Boundary**, then runs the identical engine |
| **Offline replay** | a recorded response | re-run deterministically |

Two rules keep the transports honest:
- **Worker Isolation.** A worker authors from the Stage Package + prior handoffs + `pi` + gate feedback **only** — never from platform (oracle/gate/compiler) source. Worker Mode is binary: *Package-only* (valid) vs *Used platform internals* (contaminates the interchangeability measurement).
- **Worker Conformance ≠ model quality.** A worker that emits an invalid governed projection or skips required grounding is *correctly rejected* by the compiler/oracle — a **Worker Conformance** failure, not evidence "the model is weak." The compiler is the stable component; the worker is the variable one. *The actor proposes; governance disposes.*

**Knowledge Partition** (the framing that makes this sound): **PI = what is · CR = what is desired · Worker = how to transform what-is into what-is-desired.** The worker owns *disposition* (how); it never owns *evidence* (what-is, supplied by the platform) or *desire* (what-is-desired, supplied by the human through the seed).

### 4.9 Governed Authoring Properties

Each is a mechanically-checked property, not a review convention — the pipeline can no longer silently lose it:
- **Authoring Completeness (Boundary 2 — "you cannot compute authority from meaning").** A human-owned, non-derivable input (e.g. a subdomain's Purpose) must be supplied by a human *before its first use*, or the stage halts `AUTHORING_INCOMPLETE` — the pre-stage dual of ingress `NACK`. A seed gap *is* an authoring gap, caught at the earliest phase.
- **Belief Preservation = k/N.** A worker cannot silently drop a previously-VERIFIED belief between stages: the oracle detects the omission → the worker re-queries `pi` and re-establishes evidence → the oracle confirms closure. Belief continuity is governed.
- **Projection Fidelity.** Each stage's authoritative JSON handoff must project *identically* to its markdown (no dropped rows, no missing required register). The gate that would have caught the original lossy baseline stands permanently.
- **Design Review Contract.** Every stage certifies **Part A** (engine-certified readiness, classified unknowns) and advertises a bounded **Part B** (human-engagement — decisions `pi`/governance genuinely cannot answer; questions only). A human's Part-B answer re-enters *only* through the seed (business truth), after which the pipeline replays forward; the agent never injects it mid-pipeline.
- **Execution Validity (post-construction).** A promoted change must not merely *compile* — its declared `acceptance_scenario` must *execute and observe as expected*. This is enforced as the `EXECUTION_VALIDATED` lifecycle gate (§4.11), the mechanical dual of admission: Admission proves Protocol Completeness, Execution Validation proves the behaviour runs.

### 4.10 The Construction Compiler (Stage 8)

Construction is a **second compiler** — deterministic, no worker, no authorship — that lowers the locked mandate into protocol artifacts. Its input is the **`cr_ir/`** set: the per-stage governed handoffs (`cr_ir/<stage>.json`), the authoritative **Construction Projection** S8 consumes (the stage markdown is human-facing; the JSON is the source of truth downstream).

- **Contracts own semantics; exactly one authority.** New capabilities enter as *candidate capability contracts* in a single **Compilation Unit** beside canonical ones — the compiler cannot tell candidate from canonical and applies identical rules (the former "D4" second authority dissolves rather than relocating).
- **Pipeline:** Project → Lower (execution expansion · binding propagation · store join · type propagation) → Validate → Serialize. The constraints are the gap census; the renderer only formats.
- **Propagate, never invent (`TYPED_PORT` as forcing function).** A port type is either declared on a contract Interface or propagated from one; an unresolved port is reported `TYPED_PORT / GAP_DOSSIER`, never guessed. The fix belongs at the authoring source — regenerate the stage, never patch the artifact.
- **Persistence is a binding, not a port.** A `CS` store access is a Store-Join `ACCESSES` edge (from the capability's `storage_type` + STRUCTURE), never a typed dataflow port; `TYPED_PORT` never models storage. (Full model + rationale: `pgs_change_mgmt/doc/CONSTRUCTION_MODEL_V0.md`.)

The construct step ends at **admission**: the generated delta is assembled with the canonical surface into a single **Compilation Unit** — `Baseline ∪ Generated Delta ∪ Supplementary Artifacts` (origin-agnostic; the compiler cannot tell generated from canonical) — and handed to the compiler. If it compiles, the change reaches `ADMITTED_UNVALIDATED` and the ownership decision is frozen once as a `placement_manifest.json` beside the finale set. Admission is *compile-time* completeness; it does not require the CT/CS implementations to exist yet.

### 4.11 Execution Validation (the `validate` stage)

Admission proves a delta *compiles*; Execution Validation proves it *runs as the CR intended*. It is **generic and CR-transparent**: the CR owns the *expectation*, the engine owns the *mechanism*.

- **The CR declares an `acceptance_scenario`** in its dossier (a business objective + its executable realization). The validation engine has **zero domain knowledge** — it never guesses a workflow, payload, or success criterion.
- **Mechanism:** build a fresh candidate snapshot → execute the declared scenario's workflow steps → observe → compare against declared expectations → emit `validation_report.json`. An observation may only *resolve an address and compare a value* over the **protocol surface only** — `$.steps.<id>.surface.<path>` (a field of a step's result surface) or `$.steps.<id>.store.<store>.<path>` (state of a declared store after a step; `.count` on a list). No trace parsing, no internals.
- **Verdict gates the next stage:** `EXECUTION_VALIDATED` on PASS, `EXECUTION_INVALID` otherwise. Promotion refuses without PASS evidence. The scenario itself is admissibility-checked (`VALIDATION_SCENARIO_SCHEMA`) before it runs — a malformed expectation is rejected, not silently passed.

### 4.12 Promotion, and Governance Impact (the `promote` stage — Promotion ≠ Adoption)

Promotion (Stage 9) is the only step that writes governed source. It is deliberate and hard to reverse, so it is gated three ways and is **all-or-nothing**:

- **Validation gate.** Refuses unless the change is `EXECUTION_VALIDATED`.
- **Governance-Impact gate.** During construction the CR *discovers* the exact surface additions it needs and records them descriptively in `governance_impact.json` — **discovery, not authority**. At promotion, if the canonical surface does not yet admit every required addition, promotion is **BLOCKED** with the missing FQDNs named. *A CR discovers the governance changes it needs; it never performs them.* The governance authority approves them separately by adding them to the canonical surface. **Promotion never writes governance.**
- **Compiler gate.** With `--confirm`, the finale artifact set is copied into each **owning source registry** (routed by the Placement Manifest — a cross-repo delta lands in each owning repo; **never** the read-only `protocol_snapshot/`), then the compiler recompiles. Red ⇒ rollback-all, registries unchanged. Green ⇒ `promotion_report.json` (the S9 closure certificate, symmetric with the validation report).

**Promotion ≠ Adoption.** Promotion makes a delta part of the governed source. *Adoption* — a platform deciding to evolve onto a promoted capability — is a separate, upstream authority (`platform_delta_approved.json`) that governance approves and that sits ahead of promotion. The CR surfaces impact; governance disposes; promotion only gates. This keeps a single rule intact end-to-end: **the actor proposes, governance disposes.**

### 4.13 The `pgs_change` CLI — one executable, the lifecycle as verbs

The whole lifecycle is fronted by a single executable whose four verbs *are* the state transitions of §4.1a. The CLI contains no authoring, construction, validation, or promotion logic — only dispatch — which is exactly what lets the mechanics stay governed and interchangeable. Compiler mechanics (`build` / `admit` / `persist`) are internal to `construct`, not user verbs.

| Verb | Transition | What it does |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| `pgs_change author   [--guided] --worker … [--stage N]` | `DRAFT` → mandate (S1–S7) | drives the dossier stages over the trifecta transports (§4.8) → `cr_ir/` |
| `pgs_change construct --projection … --domain … --subdomain … [--persist DIR]` | → `ADMITTED_UNVALIDATED` | lowers `cr_ir/` to a delta (build), then forms the Compilation Unit and asks the compiler (admit) |
| `pgs_change validate  --dossier <domain>/<sub>` | → `EXECUTION_VALIDATED` | runs the CR's `acceptance_scenario` against a fresh candidate snapshot |
| `pgs_change promote   --dossier … [--from DIR] [--registry-root DIR] [--confirm]` | → `PROMOTED` (S9) | validation + governance-impact gated; copies the finale set into owning registries; compiler is the gate |

`PGS_WORKSPACE` (absolute) is required — the lifecycle never guesses it from cwd. Without `--confirm`, `promote` is a dry-run that reports readiness and stops short of writing any registry.

## 5. Compiler Model

### 5.1 Pipeline Stages (in order)

| Stage | Name | What Happens |
|-------|------|-------------|
| S1 | EXTRACT | Artifact files located via STRUCTURE_ build config; deserialized into typed PIR structures; no filesystem scanning |
| S2 | CANONICALIZE | Artifacts normalized; edge typing resolved; canonical representation established |
| S3 | SEMANTIC_ADDRESSING | Semantic addresses allocated for all graph entities; address space closed |
| S4 | GOVERN | Invariants evaluated via registered assertion handlers; topology closure, step identity, canonical surface, authority/transport orthogonality, and graph completeness all checked |
| S5 | CONSTRUCT | Execution topology constructed; CT/CS IR built; CC projections assembled; bindings resolved; topology sealed |
| S6 | PROJECT | Visualization projections generated (graph JSON, PNG rendering) |
| S7 | MATERIALIZE | Compiled artifacts written to snapshot directories; evidence graph written to `evidence_snapshot/`; trace events flushed |
| S8 | VERIFY | All materialized artifacts verified on disk; hash integrity checked; evidence graph integrity validated |
| S9 | ATTEST | Cryptographic attestation computed and written for each structure and the full snapshot |

### 5.2 Compiler Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
- No execution during compilation — compiler never runs CT/CS implementations
- Static imports only — no dynamic module loading
- Deterministic output — same source → same snapshot, always
- No cross-artifact inference — each artifact is validated against its own schema + invariants
- Handler registry must be fully populated before compile starts
- Compiler validates and rejects — it never repairs malformed protocol state

### 5.3 Two Phase Types

| Phase Type | Name | Semantics |
|------------|------|-----------|
| **Phase Type A** | Per-Structure Local | DISCOVER → MATERIALIZE within a single structure; single-structure semantic closure |
| **Phase Type B** | Cross-Structure Aggregation | Consumes declared output surfaces from multiple structures; produces federated governance products |

Phase Type B is governed by an aggregation STRUCTURE_ artifact with an `aggregation_type` field. The CLI routes on this field to the appropriate aggregation runner.

**Phase Type B invariants — non-negotiable:**
- Deterministic, declarative, bounded, structure-declared
- No implicit dependency ordering between structures
- All contributing source dirs declared explicitly in `artifact_source_dirs`
- Must run after all contributing Phase Type A builds complete

**Current Phase Type B families:**

| Aggregate | `aggregation_type` | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Vocabulary | `VOCABULARY` | Implemented |
| Transport | `TRANSPORT` | Planned |
| Authority | `AUTHORITY` | Planned |
| Conformance | `CONFORMANCE` | Future |

### 5.4 Compiler Evidence Graph

The compiler emits `evidence_graph.json` per structure during S7. This is the compiler's governed observability artifact — a semantic causality graph over all S1–S7 trace events, analogous in role to the execution trace for the runtime.

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| `events` | All compiler trace events (S1–S7), typed by operation, tagged by family |
| `edges` | CAUSALITY edges + STAGE_SEQUENCE edges |
| `families` | Events bucketed by semantic concern (DISCOVERY, TOPOLOGY, ADDRESSING, GOVERNANCE, CONSTRUCTION, PROJECTION, MATERIALIZATION) |
| `evidence_graph_hash` | SHA-256 over core content; verified by S8 |
| `structure_id`, `compiler_version` | Envelope metadata — excluded from hash |

**Formal guarantees:**

| Guarantee | Statement |
|-----------|-----------|
| Causality definition | Two inferred patterns: (1) S1 `discovery_complete` → all subsequent `node_created` events; (2) S5 all `ct_ir_built` + `cs_ir_built` + `cc_projection_built` → `construction_complete` |
| Stage ordering | Exactly 7 STAGE_SEQUENCE edges (S1→S2→S3→S4→S5→S6→S7); deterministic given same source |
| Edge kind exhaustiveness | Exactly two edge kinds: `CAUSALITY` and `STAGE_SEQUENCE`. No others are permitted. Consumers may assert this. |
| Graph determinism | Same source + same compiler version → bitwise-identical `events`, `edges`, `families` content |
| Projection completeness | All events from all stages S1–S7 present; no stage selectively omitted |
| Hash contract | SHA-256 over `{event_count, edge_count, events, edges, families}` only; envelope fields excluded; verified by S8 Check 7 |
| Consumer contract | `visualization/consumers/` is the ONLY sanctioned interface; never import from `compiler/graph/*`; JSON schema is the contract |
| Replay guarantee | `evidence_graph.json` is self-contained; no compiler state or imports needed to parse it |
| VERIFICATION absence | S8's `verification_complete` is always absent by design — S7 writes the file before S8 runs; 0 VERIFICATION-family events is correct, not a defect |

**Location:** `evidence_snapshot/<domain>/evidence_graph.json` — written by S7, verified by S8.

**Contract freeze:** The `EvidenceQuery` public surface is a protocol surface, not a utility library. Additions require explicit versioning. No compiler-internal fields may be exposed.

### 5.5 Protocol Inspection (`pi`)

Compilation answers *is this protocol admissible?* Inspection answers *what does this protocol mean?* `pi` (Protocol Inspection command processor, in `pgs_compiler`, v0.6.0+) is the read-only query surface over the compiled snapshot set — the relationship-navigation tool that replaces grepping markdown and mentally reconstructing dependency graphs the compiler has already built and verified.

**Governing principle (V0):** *`pi` answers questions. The compiler performs changes. The runtime performs execution.* No mutation verb exists in the taxonomy, the CLI, or the library — including caches. Because inspection answers come from the same verified projections the runtime consumes, a `pi` result carries snapshot authority and is admissible as dossier evidence (Stage 3 impact analysis cites `pi topology impact --json` directly).

**One core, three surfaces:** the inspection library (`pgs_compiler.inspection`: loader → resolver → traversal) is the core; the terminal CLI/shell and the `--json` output (stable schema, for agents and CI) are its projections. All three return the same answer by construction.

| Property | Statement |
|----------|-----------|
| Read-only | No write API exists anywhere in the inspection path |
| Workspace explicit | `--workspace` flag or `PGS_WORKSPACE` env var; no cwd guessing |
| Validity gate | Refuses to answer unless `snapshot_status.json` is VALID |
| Zero Inference | Full FQDNs required one-shot; bare codes hard-error naming candidates; shell `use <domain>` scope is declared and visible in the prompt (`pi:<domain>>`) |
| Fail hard | Missing projection / unknown FQDN → non-zero exit with explicit cause |
| Determinism | Same snapshot + same command → byte-identical output |
| SoC | Zero runtime imports; `pi trace explain` delegates to `pgs_runtime examine` via subprocess — pi never parses traces |

**Query sources (all compiler-materialized):** `protocol_snapshot/artifact_index/` (`index.json` — FQDN → domain/structure/kind/paths/addresses; `stores.json` — entity-store ownership join), per-scope `evidence.json` (the artifact-level semantic graph: `NODE_NEXT`, `WF_CONTAINS_NODE`, `CC_BINDS_CT/CS`, `WF_BINDS_RB`, `RB_MAPS`, `GOVERNED_BY` edges), `vocabulary_snapshot/`, `pps_snapshot/index.json`, `protocol_snapshot/behavior_logic/<WF>/*.graph.json`, and `conformance_results.json`. Both index projections enter the workspace only via `pgs_compiler.cli build` — never hand-placed.

**Command taxonomy:** `pi <object> <verb> [target]` over objects `artifact`, `wf|cc|ct|cs|rb|in|ev|ac`, `topology`, `behavior_logic`, `store`, `vocab`, `pps`, `snapshot`, `trace`, plus top-level `validate` (CI gate: `--strict` exits non-zero unless VALID with zero violations) and `stats`. Bare `pi` opens the interactive shell. Full command set: `doc/pgs_cli_cheatsheet.txt`.

---

## 6. Runtime Model

### 6.1 Runtime Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
- Snapshot-only: runtime reads `protocol_snapshot/` exclusively; never touches protocol source
- No discovery: artifact locations come from the snapshot manifest, not filesystem scanning
- No inference: missing binding → hard failure; no fallback implementations
- No domain logic: runtime is semantically blind to what it executes
- Deterministic traversal: graph edges are followed exactly as declared

### 6.2 Runtime Bindings
- `RB_` maps protocol capability declarations to concrete implementations
- Both CT_ and CS_ resolved via the same binding mechanism
- RB_ resolves implementation location only — behavioral authority originates exclusively from protocol declarations

### 6.3 Trace Lifecycle

```
execution start → trace file created at traces/<domain>/<subdomain>/<TRACE_ID>/<TRACE_ID>.jsonl
each CC node   → structured event appended
execution end  → trace sealed; .md summary + .png visualization written
```

Trace files are OUTPUT only. Never use as input to compiler, runtime, or other components. Trace IDs are deterministic — same inputs produce the same trace ID. Exit codes: `0` for completed execution (including NACK/VIOLATION), `1` for infrastructure failures.

### 6.4 CS Substrate Inventory

All CS_ artifacts live in the `capability_side_effects` domain (owned by `pgs_capabilities`). The side-effect surface is finite and enumerable — this is the entire mutation/IO vocabulary:

| CS Substrate | Semantics |
|-------------|-----------|
| `CS_REGISTRY_V0` | Deduplicated key-value store; ops: REGISTER, RESOLVE, EXISTS, DEREGISTER |
| `CS_MUTABLE_JSON_V0` | Read-write JSON state; ops: WRITE, READ, DELETE, EXISTS, LIST_KEYS |
| `CS_APPENDONLY_JSONL_V0` | Immutable event stream; append only; never truncated |
| `CS_SEND_EMAIL_V0` | Email delivery side effect |
| `CS_WORKFLOW_GATEWAY_V0` | Governed sub-workflow invocation — the ONLY way one WF engages another (via a `CC_INVOKE_*` node) |
| `CS_WORKFLOW_LOOP_V0` | Governed bounded iteration over sub-workflow invocations; dispatch mapping declared, never derived at runtime |
| `CS_CONCURRENT_WORKFLOWS_V0` | Governed parallel WF dispatch; results correlated by WF FQDN (not array position); aggregate `all_succeeded` routing |
| `CS_NAME_REGISTRY_V0` | Name-scoped registry variant |

---

## 7. Execution Model

### 7.1 Governed Execution Topology

PGS execution is **governed declarative graph traversal**, not workflow orchestration. The execution topology is a compile-time governed graph — fully declared before runtime begins, immutable during execution.

```
TI → IN (admission check)
   → WF (governed topology traversal)
     → CC_1 → CT/CS → outcome (SUCCESS | VIOLATION | ALREADY_EXISTS | ...)
     → CC_2 (inputs resolved via JSONPath: $.results.<CC_CODE>.<field>)
     → ...
   → TE (boundary projection)
```

- Topology is a DAG — no cycles, deterministic termination
- All step sequences declared at compile time — runtime is a traversal engine, not an orchestrator
- Outcomes declared in WF_ route traversal — no runtime branching logic
- Runtime receives a fully closed topology graph; it does not discover, repair, or extend it

**Workflow composition rules:**
- WF nodes are IN, CC, and EXIT/EXIT_SUCCESS only — a workflow NEVER appears as a node inside another workflow
- Sub-workflow invocation is a gateway CC (`CC_INVOKE_*` bound to `CS_WORKFLOW_GATEWAY_V0`); iteration and parallelism use `CS_WORKFLOW_LOOP_V0` / `CS_CONCURRENT_WORKFLOWS_V0`
- EV_ records facts; it never triggers execution — there is no event subscription in the runtime; workflow chaining is always a declared gateway step
- A store is written only by CCs of its owning subdomain — cross-subdomain reads/calls are permitted and declared; cross-subdomain writes are forbidden without exception

### 7.2 CT Purity Invariant
- `Effect(CT) = ∅` — transforms have zero side effects
- CT may call other CTs; may never call CS
- CT correctness is the implementation's responsibility; PGS constrains invocation, not logic

### 7.3 CS Side Effect Boundary
- CS is the only authorized channel for external state mutation
- `MutationSurface = { s : s ∈ CS_ }`
- No implicit write path exists anywhere else in the system

### 7.4 Trace as Evidence
- Every node execution emits a structured trace event: artifact identity, inputs, outputs, outcome
- Trace is append-only, immutable once written
- "If an action does not appear in the trace, it is architecturally prohibited"
- Replay is deterministic: same trace → same proof

### 7.5 Ownership Boundaries

| Owner | Owns |
|-------|------|
| CC nodes | Input resolution + outcome declaration |
| CT implementations | Computation logic within declared contract |
| CS implementations | External IO within declared side-effect scope |
| Runtime | Graph traversal + trace emission |
| Compiler | Admissibility determination |

### 7.6 System Boundary Model

```
External System
      ↓
   TI_  (admission boundary — input normalization only)
      ↓
Execution Graph G  (all admissible execution semantics live here)
      ↓
   TE_  (projection boundary — output rendering only)
      ↓
External System
```

TI_ and TE_ are orthogonal boundary concerns — they do not participate in workflow authority or execution orchestration.

### 7.7 Execution Topology Governance

**Doctrine:** Execution topology governs traversal structure only.

| Topology Property | Statement |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Compile-time governed | All step sequences, routing, and input bindings fully declared before runtime |
| Declarative | Steps are declared; not inferred, not synthesized, not discovered |
| Immutable after compilation | Compiled topology cannot be modified, extended, or overridden at runtime |
| Traversal-only scope | Topology governs which capabilities execute in what sequence — nothing else |
| Authority orthogonal | Topology may not branch on role, permission, or actor state |
| Transport orthogonal | Topology may not encode HTTP endpoints, transport conditions, or dispatch logic |
| Closure required | All step inputs must resolve at compile time; no forward references; no dangling references |
| No runtime synthesis | Topology may not be generated or inferred from payload content or environment state |

**Canonical surface governance:** Every step's `result_surface` must exactly match the `canonical_surface` declared by the governing `SURFACE_CONTRACT`. Workflow authors MAY route surfaces. Workflow authors MAY NOT define capability semantics.

**Topology invariant families (compile-time enforced):**
- Step identity uniqueness · Capability reference uniqueness · Input reference closure
- Routing completeness · Contract closure · Authority orthogonality
- Transport orthogonality · Surface canonicality

---

## 8. Architectural Properties

The PGS architecture produces eleven named properties. These are not design goals — they are structural outcomes that follow directly from the Governance → Compiler → Runtime separation. Each is derived in full in the technical paper trilogy.

| Property | Statement |
|----------|-----------|
| **Implementation Independence** | Protocol behavior can be executed without coupling to a specific implementation. The implementation can be replaced entirely without changing protocol behavior. The protocol can evolve entirely without changing the runtime. |
| **Hosting Transparency** | The Protocol Snapshot is indifferent to the substrate executing it. A deployment decision changes where execution happens. It cannot change what execution means. |
| **Projection Independence** | Governance is separable from execution representation. Multiple projections of the same compiled truth can be produced; selecting one does not alter governed behavior. |
| **Security as Projection Choice** | Security posture improves by choosing a more constrained execution projection — without changing the protocol. What the runtime cannot know, an attacker cannot exploit through it. |
| **Runtime Multiplicity** | One protocol, one compiled snapshot, many conforming runtimes — cloud, edge, embedded, hardware — all executing identical behavior and producing semantically equivalent traces. |
| **Transport Orthogonality** | The workflow topology is constitutionally ignorant of its invocation surface. A workflow executed via CLI and the same workflow executed via REST API are indistinguishable at the topology level. |
| **Structural Parallelism** | Concurrency is not engineered into PGS. It is a structural consequence of protocol topology. The runtime exploits independence declared by the topology, not independence created by implementation. |
| **Runtime Stability** | The runtime reaches a stable execution contract before the protocol stabilizes. Protocol evolution produces new snapshots. The runtime executes them without modification. New domains do not introduce new runtime code paths. |
| **Trace Portability** | Execution evidence is substrate-neutral. Traces produced by a cloud runtime and an embedded firmware runtime executing the same snapshot are semantically equivalent and structurally comparable. |
| **Governance Dividend** | As governance surface matures, cost-of-change decreases rather than increases. Governance complexity compounds; execution complexity does not. |
| **Determinism** | Identical inputs produce identical execution paths and identical traces across every conforming runtime on every conforming substrate. This is not engineered into deployments — it is a property of the architecture. |

> The compiler governs possibility. The runtime governs realization. The separation between them is where Protocol-Governed Systems become governable.

## 9. Transport Governance

### 9.1 TI / TE Doctrine
- **TI (Transport Ingress):** Normalizes and validates all external input → canonical internal representation. No business logic.
- **TE (Transport Egress):** Renders internal results for external systems. Boundary projection only. Does not participate in execution semantics.
- Closed-loop invariant: all behavior follows `TI → G → TE`

### 9.2 Transport Orthogonality
- Transport substrate (CLI, HTTP, queue, agent) is orthogonal to execution semantics
- Changing from CLI to HTTP does not change the execution graph
- No routing logic in TI/TE — routing lives in WF_ declarations

### 9.3 Transport Does Not Route
- Transport artifacts normalize and project data only
- Transport may not perform execution routing, orchestration, or behavioral selection
- All routing lives in WF_ DAG outcome edges — never in TI/TE middleware

### 9.4 Snapshot-Driven Route Loading
- Routes loaded from snapshot; no hardcoded route tables
- Route = (domain, workflow) pair declared in snapshot
- No middleware intelligence — middleware is transport plumbing only

### 9.5 Transport Federation Doctrine

Transport governance requires Phase Type B federated aggregation to synthesize: route indices · admission maps · projection schemas · transport boundary manifests.

Transport aggregation **may synthesize:** routes · projections · admission maps

Transport aggregation **may NEVER:** mutate execution semantics · alter workflows · inject orchestration · infer routing behavior dynamically

> **Transport is not federated execution; it is federated boundary governance.**

---

## 10. Federated Governance

**Architectural transition:** PGS has evolved from *protocol-governed execution* to *federated governance compilation* — a substantially more powerful architecture class.

### 10.1 Definition

A **Federated Governance Domain** is a cross-structure governance concern that:
- cannot be semantically closed within a single domain structure
- requires contribution from multiple domain builds
- is compiled via Phase Type B aggregation
- produces a governed artifact consumed by execution, transport, or runtime

### 10.2 Canonical Domain Families

| Domain Type | Example | Product | What It Governs |
|-------------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Federated Aggregation | Vocabulary | `vocabulary_symbols.json` + semantic index | Protocol ontology; expressible concern surface |
| Federated Boundary | Transport | route index, admission maps, projection schemas | Boundary admission and projection topology |
| Federated Admissibility | Authority | admissibility maps, actor eligibility graphs | Execution eligibility and observation rights |
| Federated Correctness | Conformance (future) | global correctness assertions | Cross-structure invariant enforcement |
| Federated Topology | Federation (future) | topology graph | Cross-runtime structure relationships |

### 10.3 Invariants for All Federated Domains

**Macro-invariant:** Federated governance domains may synthesize governance products but may not synthesize execution semantics.

Every federated governance domain must:
- be declared via an aggregation STRUCTURE_ artifact with an explicit `aggregation_type`
- declare all contributing source dirs explicitly (`artifact_source_dirs`)
- produce deterministic output given the same inputs
- run after all contributing Phase Type A builds complete
- introduce no execution node types, runtime graph primitives, or middleware chains
- preserve orthogonality with the execution layer

### 10.4 Boundary Orthogonality

Federated governance products may never: mutate execution semantics · alter declared workflow behavior · inject orchestration logic · infer behavioral routing dynamically · become smart runtime components.

Authority governs whether execution may exist. Transport governs where boundaries are. Neither touches how the execution graph runs.

### 10.5 Architectural Significance

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Protocol-governed execution | Federated governance compilation |
| Vocabulary is per-structure output | Vocabulary is a federated ontology product |
| Transport routes are implicit | Transport routing is a compiled, governed artifact |
| Authority is runtime middleware | Authority is a compiled admissibility domain |
| Governance is per-artifact | Governance is a compounding federated product |

---

## 11. Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Violates PGS | Correct Approach |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Smart runtime | Embeds domain logic in execution layer | Runtime is generic; all behavior in compiled snapshot |
| Fallback logic | Masks architectural violations; introduces non-determinism | Hard failure; fix the root cause |
| Dynamic imports | Breaks static resolution; enables runtime code injection | Static imports only; handler registry at compile time |
| Filesystem inference | Violates zero-inference doctrine | Declare all paths explicitly |
| Relative path traversal (`../`) | Path guessing; breaks portability | Script-relative or env-var-driven explicit paths |
| Editing `protocol_snapshot/` | Modifies compiler output; overwritten on next build | Change protocol source → recompile |
| Using trace as input | Trace is evidence, not protocol; breaks separation | Traces are output only |
| Hardcoded absolute paths | Environment coupling | Declare via env vars or explicit script parameters |
| CT calling CS | Breaks CT purity invariant | CS calls only from CC-authorized pathways |
| Middleware routing logic | Transport coupling; breaks transport orthogonality | Routing in WF_ topology only |
| Role-branching in topology steps | Embeds authority semantics in execution topology | Authority evaluation happens before topology traversal; topology assumes admissibility is resolved |
| `result_surface` deviation from canonical | Workflow author redefines what a capability produces | Declare the exact `canonical_surface` from the governing SURFACE_CONTRACT — routing is permitted, redefinition is not |
| Runtime step injection | Synthesizes topology from payload or environment | All steps declared at compile time; topology sealed before runtime begins |
| Event-driven triggering | EV_ is observability/control plane; runtime has no subscription mechanism | Workflow chaining via gateway CC (`CC_INVOKE_*` on `CS_WORKFLOW_GATEWAY_V0`); events record the fact |
| WF node inside a WF | Workflows are not node types; embedding breaks topology closure | Sub-workflow invocation via gateway CC; loop/concurrent variants via their CS substrates |
| Cross-subdomain store write | Violates store ownership boundary | Dependency-gap CC owned by the store's subdomain, declared in the CR (§4.3) |
| Authoring what already exists | Re-creates baseline capability under a new name; splits identity | Search the snapshot inventory (PPS index) before declaring any new artifact |
| Environment-driven branching | Implicit behavior; breaks determinism | Explicit outcomes in protocol artifacts |
| Short-name artifact references | Breaks FQDN identity; causes resolution failures | Always use `domain::ARTIFACT_CODE` |
| Package install during operation | Execution environment must be pre-resolved | Resolve all dependencies at bootstrap time |
| `sys.path` manipulation | Breaks import isolation | Proper package installs via editable installs |

## 12. Architecture Evolution

Understanding why the architecture looks as it does prevents re-introducing solved problems.

| Evolution | What Changed | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Short-name → FQDN | All artifact identifiers now require `domain::CODE` format | Eliminated ambiguity when multiple domains co-exist in snapshot |
| Runtime decoupling | Runtime became fully domain-agnostic | Enabled same engine to run blockchain and AI governance without modification |
| Transport governance formalization | TI/TE defined as distinct concern types | Separated projection semantics from execution semantics; enabled transport orthogonality |
| CT binding refactor | RB_ now resolves both CT_ and CS_ symmetrically | Eliminated split binding mechanism; runtime is fully implementation-agnostic |
| Snapshot sovereignty | `protocol_snapshot/` declared formally read-only | Prevented drift between compiled and live behavior |
| TE ontology correction | TE confirmed as boundary projection only; not an execution concern | Clarified that TE has no authority in execution; projection is structural, not behavioral |
| Federated governance compilation | Compiler gained Phase Type B (cross-structure aggregation); vocabulary was first federated governance product | Single-structure compilation cannot close over cross-structure semantics; vocabulary, transport, and authority require multi-domain synthesis |
| Protocol-governed execution → federated governance compilation | Architecture class elevated: PGS now governs ontology, routing, and admissibility as compiled artifacts | Governance surfaces compound without runtime coupling; execution remains semantically blind while governance grows richer |
| Execution topology formalized as governed surface | Execution graph structure elevated from convention to constitutional governance surface with 8 enforced invariants | Topology closure, step identity, canonical surface, authority/transport orthogonality, and runtime synthesis prohibition are now compile-time enforced |
| Governed declarative graph traversal | PGS execution is no longer adequately described as "workflow orchestration" | Topology is compile-time declared, authority-orthogonal, transport-orthogonal, and immutable after compilation; these properties are now constitutional, not conventional |
| Constitutional Federation | Governance registry organized as `registry/FB_*/` (14 boundaries); `fb.*::` is the only valid namespace for governance artifacts | Federation boundaries are first-class semantic constructs. Governance sovereignty is physically visible in the registry. |
| Compiler evidence graph | Compiler gained a governed observability artifact: `evidence_graph.json` per structure; CAUSALITY + STAGE_SEQUENCE typed edges; SHA-256 hash integrity | Compiler is now self-observable; evidence graph enables visualization, AI tooling, replay, and debugging from a stable JSON schema without importing compiler internals |
| Governed Evidence System convergence | PGS architecture converges on three compounding properties: Protocol Compiler + Governed Evidence System + Deterministic Execution Fabric | This combination is an unusual architectural category. Cost-of-change decreasing with system growth is repeatedly demonstrated architectural behavior, not an aspirational claim. |
| Closed-loop governed evolution (v0.5.0) | Change management became a governed concern: `FB_CHANGE_MGMT` boundary, `pgs_change_mgmt` repo, staged CR→Mandate pipeline with dossiers, gates, and purity ladder (§4) | Construction and execution were governed; evolution was not. An ungoverned change process accumulates the same rationale decay PGS eliminates elsewhere — the pipeline closes the loop |
| Orchestration substrate | Workflow composition gained governed primitives: `CS_WORKFLOW_GATEWAY_V0`, `CS_WORKFLOW_LOOP_V0`, `CS_CONCURRENT_WORKFLOWS_V0`; events confirmed as facts, never triggers | Workflow-to-workflow engagement, iteration, and parallelism are declared side effects — not runtime orchestration logic, not event subscriptions |
| Subdomain store ownership | A store is written only by its owning subdomain's CCs; peer writes are dependency-gap CCs owned by the peer | Store ownership is a governance boundary; cross-subdomain writes were never legal — the doctrine is now explicit and template-enforced |
| Trifecta authoring + Construction Compiler | Authoring became transport-invariant (automated · guided · offline over one worker interface, §4.8); Stage 8 gained a deterministic Construction Compiler that lowers `cr_ir/` mandates into artifacts under contract authority — candidate capability contracts, propagate-never-invent, `TYPED_PORT` gaps (§4.10) | Proved the *pipeline*, not the model, carries the intelligence: a weaker worker needs more gate iterations but converges on the same governed output. Governed authoring properties — Authoring Completeness, Belief Preservation, Projection Fidelity — are now mechanically enforced, not review conventions (§4.9) |
| Full change-management lifecycle + unified CLI (v0.8.0) | The pipeline gained an explicit lifecycle — `DRAFT → CONSTRUCTION_COMPLETE → ADMITTED_UNVALIDATED → EXECUTION_VALIDATED → PROMOTED` — fronted by one executable, `pgs_change` (author · construct · validate · promote, §4.11–4.13); admission and execution validation are distinct gates, and Governance Impact / Promotion≠Adoption separate discovery from authority | Change-management output is an **admitted protocol delta**, not code — and "it compiles" is not "it runs." Admission proves Protocol Completeness; Execution Validation proves the behaviour runs; Promotion is compiler-gated and rollback-all-on-red. A CR *discovers* the governance changes it needs but never performs them (§4.12) |

---

## Architectural Invariants

Hard constraints. Violation = operational failure or architectural corruption.

| Invariant | Statement |
|-----------|-----------|
| FQDN Required | All artifact filenames and references must use `domain::ARTIFACT_CODE` — no short names |
| Snapshot Immutability | `protocol_snapshot/` is READ-ONLY at runtime; never edit by hand |
| No Runtime Discovery | Runtime resolves artifacts from snapshot manifest only; no filesystem scanning |
| No Execution in Compiler | Compiler never runs CT/CS/domain implementations |
| No Transport Execution Logic | TI/TE perform normalization and projection only; no business logic |
| No Hidden State Mutation | All state changes through explicitly declared CS_ artifacts |
| No Ambient Authority | Code has no inherent authority; all authority from (AC, IN, WF, CC) declarations |
| No Fallback | Missing binding, missing artifact, violated invariant → hard failure |
| Trace Output Only | Traces written to `traces/` by runtime; never used as input to any component |
| Data Root Explicit | `--data-root` must be explicitly passed; never inferred |
| Static Imports Only | No dynamic imports in compiler handlers or operational scripts |
| No sys.path Manipulation | System path must not be modified in scripts or handlers |
| Protocol Recompile Required | To change behavior → change protocol source → recompile → rebuild snapshot |
| CT Purity | CT implementations must be free of side effects; no CS calls from CT |
| Topology Immutability | Compiled execution topology is immutable; no step added, removed, or rerouted at runtime |
| Topology Closure | All step inputs must resolve at compile time; no dangling references |
| No Runtime Topology Synthesis | Execution topology may not be generated or inferred from payload, environment, or runtime state |
| Topology Traversal Scope | Execution topology governs traversal structure only; may not encode authority or transport semantics |
| Canonical Surface | Every step's `result_surface` must exactly match the `canonical_surface` declared in the governing SURFACE_CONTRACT |
| Evidence Consumer Isolation | `visualization/consumers/` must never import from `compiler/graph/*`; JSON schema is the only contract |
| Evidence Hash Contract | `evidence_graph_hash` covers only `{event_count, edge_count, events, edges, families}`; envelope fields excluded |
| VERIFICATION Family Absent | `evidence_graph.json` covers S1–S7 by design; 0 VERIFICATION-family events is architecturally correct |

## Appendix B: Artifact Reference

### Snapshot Structure

```
protocol_snapshot/
  artifacts/
    workflows/                       ← WF_ JSON
    capability_contracts/            ← CC_ JSON
    capability_transforms/           ← CT_ JSON
    capability_side_effects/         ← CS_ JSON
    runtime_bindings/                ← RB_ JSON
    intents/                         ← IN_ JSON
    events/                          ← EV_ JSON
    actors/                          ← AC_ JSON
    layers/ invariants/ assertions/  ← governance (compiled from all 14 FB_* boundaries)
  visualization/<WF_NAME>/
    <WF_NAME>.graph.json             ← machine-readable DAG
    <WF_NAME>.projection.png         ← visual graph

evidence_snapshot/                   ← compiler observability (written by S7, verified by S8)
  <domain>/
    evidence_graph.json              ← semantic causality graph; events + edges + families + hash
```

Both `protocol_snapshot/` and `evidence_snapshot/` are READ-ONLY post-build. Never edit by hand. To change: modify protocol source and recompile.

### Trace Structure

```
traces/<domain>/<subdomain>/<TRACE_ID>/
  <TRACE_ID>.jsonl    ← append-only structured event log (input to pgs_runtime examine)
  <TRACE_ID>.md       ← human-readable summary
  <TRACE_ID>.png      ← execution path visualization
```

### FQDN Format

```
<domain>::<ARTIFACT_CODE>_V<version>

Examples:
  blockchain::WF_REGISTER_ACTOR_UNVERIFIED_V0
  ai_governance::WF_GOVERN_AGENT_ACTION_V0
  blockchain::CC_GENERATE_ACTOR_ID_V0
  capability_transforms::CT_PURE_GENERATE_ID_V0

Note: CT_ artifacts live in the capability_transforms domain.
      CS_ artifacts live in the capability_side_effects domain.

Governance artifacts use fb.* namespace:
  fb.constitution::CONSTITUTION_FEDERATION_BOUNDARY_V0
  fb.topology::CONSTITUTION_EXECUTION_TOPOLOGY_V0
  fb.constitution::STRUCTURE_BUILD_PLATFORM_CONFIG_V0
```

**Filesystem separator:** `::` in code → `__` (double-underscore) in filenames:
```
blockchain__WF_REGISTER_ACTOR_UNVERIFIED_V0.json
```

Short-code calls to `load_bootstrap_artifact()` without `fb.*::` namespace raise a hard `ValueError` — no fallback.

### Execution Outcome Vocabulary

**Intent outcomes (IN_ gate):**
```
ACK     Admission accepted — graph traversal proceeds
NACK    Admission rejected — execution halted before graph entry
```

**CC node outcomes:**
```
SUCCESS          Normal forward completion
ALREADY_EXISTS   Idempotency guard triggered (registry)
VIOLATION        Constraint violated (governance, invariant)
DENIED           Authorization failed
BACKEND_ERROR    Infrastructure or implementation error at CS/CT boundary
```

### Data State Layout

```
data/<domain>/<subdomain>/...        ← one subtree per FB-aligned subdomain
  blockchain/
    identity/        registry/actors.json · events/identity_events.jsonl
    wallet/          state/wallets.json · events/wallet_events.jsonl
    transaction/     state/transactions.json · events/transaction_events.jsonl
    mempool/         state/mempool.json · registry/mempool_index.json
    block/           blocks/blocks.json · events/block_events.jsonl
    consensus_pos/   registry/validators.json · rounds/rounds.jsonl · events/*.jsonl
    orchestration/   state/slot_clock.json · events/simulation_summary.jsonl
  ai_governance/
    ai_licensing/    license_facts.json (read-only seed) · license_registry.json · audit_log.jsonl
    agent_governance/  governance_actions.json · governance_audit.jsonl
```

Storage topology is declared in STRUCTURE artifacts (`entity_stores`) and resolved via RB_ — never hardcode paths. Registry stores are deduplicated; `events/` journals are append-only and never truncated; seeds in `seeds/` are source of truth, copied to `data/` by bootstrap.

## Appendix D: Debugging Guide

### Common Failure Signatures

| Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |
|---------|------------|-----|
| `ExecutionError: no binding for CT_...` | CT declared in protocol; no RB_ entry | Add RB_ binding for that CT |
| `ValidationError: payload rejected at IN_...` | Payload violates Intent admission rules | Check IN_ schema; fix payload fields |
| `BuildError: conformance check failed` | Protocol artifact violates invariant | Run compiler with `--verbose`; read assertion output |
| `ALREADY_EXISTS` outcome | CS_REGISTRY_V0 found duplicate key | Correct behavior — registry is idempotent by protocol design |
| Editing `protocol_snapshot/` has no effect | Snapshot is compiled output; runtime reads sealed state | Modify protocol source → recompile → rebuild snapshot |
| `SnapshotError: artifact not found` | FQDN mismatch or artifact missing from build scope | Check STRUCTURE_ config includes the artifact's domain |
| Trace shows unexpected routing | Outcome name from CC does not match WF edge | Check CC outcome declarations against WF routing edges |
| Runtime binding resolution fails | Implementation path changed; RB_ not updated | Update RB_ artifact to point to new implementation |

### Compile vs Runtime Failures

| Type | When Detected | Meaning |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Invariant violation | Compile time | Artifact violates constitutional law — cannot enter snapshot |
| Schema validation failure | Compile time | Artifact malformed — field missing or wrong type |
| Missing binding | Runtime startup | Snapshot present but RB_ not wired to implementation |
| Payload rejection | Runtime, at IN_ | Input does not satisfy admission conditions |
| CC outcome mismatch | Runtime, in DAG | Declared outcome not in WF routing table |

### Trace Debugging

```bash
pgs_runtime examine ./traces/<domain>/<subdomain>/<TRACE_ID>/<TRACE_ID>.jsonl
# Each event: artifact_id, inputs, outputs, outcome, timestamp
# .md file: human-readable summary
# .png file: visual execution path
```

### Snapshot Mismatch
If runtime behavior diverges from expected: recompile and sync. Never patch `protocol_snapshot/` manually — it will be overwritten by next build.

---

## Appendix E: Refactor Patterns

### Add a New Artifact Family
1. Define schema in `pgs_governance`
2. Write constitution with invariants
3. Implement assertion handlers (static imports only)
4. Register handlers in handler registry
5. Add STRUCTURE_ config entry to include new family
6. Recompile

### Add a New CT (Capability Transform)
1. Implement deterministic function in `pgs_capabilities` (no side effects)
2. Declare `CT_<NAME>_V0` artifact in the relevant domain repo
3. Add `RB_` binding entry mapping declaration to implementation
4. Reference CT in `CC_` capability contract within a workflow
5. Recompile and sync snapshot

### Add a New CS (Capability Side Effect)
1. Implement storage/IO operation in `pgs_capabilities`
2. Declare `CS_<NAME>_V0` artifact in the relevant domain repo (defines semantics, not implementation)
3. Add `RB_` binding entry
4. Reference CS in `CC_` within a workflow
5. Recompile and sync snapshot

### Add a New Domain
1. Create new repo (e.g., `pgs_<domain>`)
2. Author protocol artifacts: `WF_`, `CC_`, `IN_`, `EV_` for the domain
3. Add `STRUCTURE_BUILD_<DOMAIN>_CONFIG_V0` in `pgs_compiler`
4. **Add the domain layer entry in `STRUCTURE_DISCOVERY_V0`** — set `registry_module` to the sub-module path (e.g., `pgs_<domain>.registry`), **not** the top-level package. The compiler's `LayerResolver` uses `module_root.parent` to locate the repo root; pointing to the top-level package resolves the wrong parent directory and produces zero compiled artifacts.
5. Wire reusable CT/CS from `pgs_capabilities` via `RB_`
6. Implement any domain-specific CT/CS (rarely needed if library is mature)
7. Compile and sync
8. Add domain to workspace bootstrap and HTTP server config

### Add a TI Route (HTTP Endpoint)
1. Declare `TI_` artifact in protocol
2. Add static UI payload directory under domain testbed
3. Reference TI in HTTP server `--domain` flag
4. Snapshot-driven route registration happens automatically

### Extend STRUCTURE Governance
1. Modify `STRUCTURE_BUILD_*_CONFIG_V0` artifact in `pgs_compiler`
2. Add new artifact directories or scope inclusions
3. Recompile — no runtime changes required

---

## Appendix F: Coding Directives

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Absolute imports only | No `sys.path` manipulation; no relative import hacks |
| Layer isolation | CT cannot call CS; runtime cannot contain domain logic; compiler cannot execute |
| No fallback logic | Missing artifact = failure; no silent defaults |
| No dynamic discovery | Artifact locations declared, not scanned |
| No runtime inference | Runtime resolves from snapshot only; never infers from filesystem |
| No hidden state mutation | All state changes through declared CS_ only |
| No hardcoded absolute paths | Use script-relative or env-var-driven paths declared explicitly |
| FQDN everywhere | `domain::ARTIFACT_CODE` — no short names, ever |
| Static imports only | In operational scripts and compiler handlers |
| Environment pre-resolved | All dependencies resolved at bootstrap time; no installation during operation |

---

## Appendix G: Repo Map and Quick Reference

### Repository Map

| Repo | Layer | Responsibility |
|------|-------|---------------|
| `pgs_governance` | Governance | Constitutional governance, federated boundaries, invariant enforcement |
| `pgs_compiler` | Compiler | Compiler pipeline, admissibility construction, conformance generation |
| `pgs_transport` | Transport | Ingress/egress adapters for HTTP and CLI surfaces |
| `pgs_runtime` | Execution | pgs_runtime CLI; deterministic DAG traversal; snapshot loading |
| `pgs_capabilities` | Capability Substrate | Shared CT_ and CS_ implementations; reusable capability library |
| `pgs_blockchain` | Domain | Blockchain workflows: identity, wallet, transaction, mempool, consensus_pos, orchestration (chain in flight) |
| `pgs_ai_governance` | Domain | AI governance workflows: licensing, agent action, agent admission, reclaim |
| `pgs_change_mgmt` | Governed Evolution | Change-management lifecycle (§4): stage templates, dossiers, agent context manifest, `engine/` lifecycle services + the `pgs_change` CLI (author · construct · validate · promote, §4.11–4.13) |
| `pgs_workspace` | Entry Point | Compiled snapshot + operational scripts; public developer entry |

**Dependency direction:** `pgs_workspace` → domains → capabilities → runtime ← compiler ← governance
**Change-management direction:** `pgs_change_mgmt` → `pgs_compiler` (validation) + `pgs_workspace` (PPS snapshot, read-only)

### Artifact Prefix Quick Reference

```
WF_  Workflow             CC_  Capability Contract
CT_  Transform            CS_  Side Effect
IN_  Intent               RB_  Runtime Binding
EV_  Event                AC_  Actor Context

### High-Value Grep Patterns

```bash
# List all workflow artifacts
ls protocol_snapshot/artifacts/workflows/

# Find binding for a specific CT
grep -r "CT_<NAME>" protocol_snapshot/artifacts/runtime_bindings/

# Find which CC uses a given CS
grep -r "CS_<NAME>" protocol_snapshot/artifacts/capability_contracts/

# Find trace events for a specific CC
grep '"artifact_id": "blockchain::CC_<NAME>"' \
  traces/<domain>/<subdomain>/<TRACE_ID>/<TRACE_ID>.jsonl

# Check snapshot validity marker
grep "status" protocol_snapshot/artifacts/workflows/*.json | head -5
```

## Research Classification

Doctrine must never be contaminated by unvalidated claims. Every statement derived from an experiment carries a standing classification, and only the first two grades may harden into doctrine:

| Grade | Meaning | May enter doctrine? |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| **Validated Finding** | Reproduced; mechanism understood; survives adversarial check | Yes — as doctrine |
| **Candidate Invariant** | Holds so far; not yet reproduced across domains (n=1) | Yes — flagged provisional |
| **Hypothesis** | Plausible, untested | No — track only |
| **Retracted Finding** | Was believed, now disproven | No — record the retraction, not the claim |
| **Worker Observation** | A trait of the specific worker/harness, not the system | No — benchmark fact, never governance |

A claim is promoted only by re-grading, never by repetition. Worker Observations (e.g. a given model's verbosity, discovery weakness, or run-to-run variance) are explicitly out of permanent scope — see §4.7 System Boundary.

## Manual Evolution Rule

**New content must improve architectural cognition density.**

If information is already obvious from source code or protocol artifacts, it does not belong here. If a section does not improve architectural decision quality or cognitive restoration speed, it does not belong here.

PGS prioritizes architectural stability over feature velocity. When architectural tradeoffs occur, preference is given to: explicitness over convenience · governance over heuristics · determinism over flexibility · compile-time enforcement over runtime repair.
