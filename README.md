## Why this exists

Modern software has a governance problem.

As systems become:
- distributed,
- event-driven,
- AI-assisted,
- and increasingly machine-generated,

the gap between:
- what engineers *intended*,
and
- what software is actually *allowed to do*

keeps widening.

Behavior hides in:
- orchestration code,
- runtime conditionals,
- framework conventions,
- implicit routing,
- service glue,
- and increasingly, AI-generated implementation details.

PGS explores a different model:

> What if behavior was governed *before execution* instead of inferred *during execution*?

---

# What is PGS?

PGS is a **Protocol-Governed Execution Architecture** where:

- behavior is declared in governed protocol artifacts
- admissible execution paths are compiled ahead of time
- runtime traversal is deterministic
- undeclared behavior is unreachable
- every execution produces structured evidence

The runtime does not "figure out" what to do.

It traverses a precompiled execution graph.

---

# What makes this different?

Most workflow systems orchestrate code.

PGS governs behavior itself.

Traditional systems still allow:
- hidden routing,
- implicit side effects,
- undeclared execution paths,
- runtime interpretation,
- and logic spread across services.

PGS moves those concerns into:
- protocol declarations,
- compiler-enforced invariants,
- federated governance boundaries,
- and deterministic execution topology.

This is not a framework abstraction.

It is a different execution model.

---

# Why this matters in the AI era

AI can generate software faster than humans can reliably govern it.

PGS was designed around a simple premise:

> AI-generated behavior should not bypass architectural admissibility.

In PGS:
- execution legality is compiled before runtime
- side effects are explicitly declared
- routing surfaces are closed
- execution traces are immutable
- runtime is intentionally semantic-agnostic

The system cannot invent undeclared behavior at execution time.

# What you are looking at

This repository is the **reference workspace** for the Protocol-Governed Systems ecosystem.

It demonstrates:
- governed workflow execution
- compile-time admissibility construction
- federated governance boundaries
- deterministic runtime traversal
- immutable execution traces
- semantic-agnostic execution infrastructure

This is not a toy mockup.

The workflows execute end-to-end against real state and produce real traces.

---

# Core Architectural Idea

PGS separates software into two distinct spaces:

| Space | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Human Governance Space | Defines what behavior is admissible |
| Machine Execution Space | Executes only what has already been declared and compiled |

This inversion matters.

The runtime is not trusted to "do the right thing."

The compiler constrains what the runtime is even capable of doing.

---

# What happens when you run this?

You will execute real workflows against persistent state.

You will observe:
- deterministic routing
- compile-time constrained behavior
- immutable structured traces
- different outcomes from the same workflow without code changes
- runtime execution without orchestration logic embedded in services

The protocol — not handwritten runtime branching — governs outcomes.

---

# What PGS is NOT

PGS is not:
- a low-code workflow builder
- a BPM engine
- an orchestration DSL
- a rules engine
- an agent framework
- or another event bus abstraction

It is a governed execution substrate.

---

# Who is this for?

- Engineers building high-integrity systems
- Teams integrating AI-generated code safely
- Architects exploring deterministic execution models
- Researchers interested in governed computation
- Anyone curious what software looks like when protocol becomes the source of truth

---

# Architecture Highlights

- Compile-time admissibility enforcement
- Federated governance boundaries (FB_*)
- Semantic-agnostic runtime execution
- Deterministic execution graphs
- Immutable execution evidence
- Fully declared side-effect surfaces
- Protocol-first system evolution
- FQDN-based artifact identity
- Governance-constrained compiler behavior

---

# Open Source

PGS is released under Apache-2.0.

The goal is not to create a closed platform.

The goal is to explore whether software systems can become:
- more governable,
- more inspectable,
- and more deterministic

without sacrificing extensibility.
