# About Bachi

I design systems meant to outlast the code that builds them.

My career began in industrial automation — across iron & steel, cement, and
petrochemical plants — where I designed motor control and automation systems and
contributed patented work. Those systems taught me something software often forgets: when
abstractions are correct, systems can run deterministically for decades without change.

I later spent over 28 years at **The Boeing Company**, working at the intersection of
control systems, large-scale engineering, and computing architecture, ultimately serving
as a **Technical Fellow**. Over time, a contrast became impossible to ignore.

The industrial control systems I designed early in my career are still running — unchanged,
reliable, deterministic. Business software written five years ago is often considered
legacy.

The difference isn't engineering talent. It's architectural philosophy.

Control systems separate **what should happen** from **how it happens**. Business software
tangles them together, embedding domain logic in imperative code that becomes increasingly
hard to reason about, verify, or evolve.

There's a simple analogy most software systems ignore: we don't design a unique operating
system for every application — so why do we design unique execution logic for every
business system?

Operating systems exist precisely to separate intent from mechanism. Applications declare
what they need; the OS governs how execution occurs — consistently, deterministically, and
independently of any single application's logic. Business software, by contrast, repeatedly
reinvents its own execution machinery, embedding behavior directly into code and paying the
price in fragility and decay.

## From philosophy to architecture

**Protocol-Governed Systems (PGS)** is my answer to three decades of watching software decay
unnecessarily — an architecture in which business logic exists as validated, declarative
data, not code; where workflows are mathematically constrained before they run; and where a
single execution engine, written once, executes across domains with deterministic precision
and a complete audit trail.

**OmniBachi is the reference implementation of PGS.** It formalizes the architecture:
protocol authority as the source of truth, semantically blind execution, contract-bound
capabilities, and derived consequences. But the deeper work is philosophical — arguing that
**protocols, not code, should be the substrate of business systems.**

I write about these ideas in the **[Protocol-Governed Systems essay series](/blog/)**: the
economics of protocol-driven computing, the mathematics of deterministic execution, and why
10,000 workflows shouldn't require 10,000,000 lines of code.

Outside engineering, I write fiction under the pen name *Bachi* and practice regenerative
backyard gardening — both exercises in building systems that sustain themselves over time.
