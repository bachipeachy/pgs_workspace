# Appendix B — Protocol Snapshot Reference

The canonical set of compiled protocol artifacts is maintained in the `protocol_snapshot/` directory of the `pgs_workspace` repository.

> **Why a live pointer instead of a static appendix?**
> Prior editions included artifact listings in this appendix. Protocol artifacts are versioned, evolving artifacts — a static copy ages immediately. The live snapshot is always authoritative.

## How to Browse

```bash
# List all workflows
ls protocol_snapshot/artifacts/workflows/

# List all capability side effects
ls protocol_snapshot/artifacts/capability_side_effects/

# Read a specific artifact
cat protocol_snapshot/artifacts/workflows/blockchain__WF_REGISTER_ACTOR_UNVERIFIED_V0.json
```

## Naming Convention

All artifact filenames follow FQDN format:

```
<domain>::<ARTIFACT_CODE>.json
```

Examples:
- `blockchain__WF_REGISTER_ACTOR_UNVERIFIED_V0.json`
- `ai_governance__AC_AGENT_V0.json`
- `capability_transforms__CT_PURE_GENERATE_ID_V0.json`

## Current Artifact Counts

| Type | Directory | Count |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Workflows (`WF_`) | `workflows/` | See snapshot |
| Capability Contracts (`CC_`) | `capability_contracts/` | See snapshot |
| Capability Transforms (`CT_`) | `capability_transforms/` | See snapshot |
| Capability Side Effects (`CS_`) | `capability_side_effects/` | 6 |
| Runtime Bindings (`RB_`) | `runtime_bindings/` | 7 |
| Intents (`IN_`) | `intents/` | See snapshot |
| Actors (`AC_`) | `actors/` | 7 |
| Assertions (`AS_`) | `assertions/` | See snapshot |

Counts marked "See snapshot" vary as domains evolve. The six CS\_ runtime types and seven RB\_ artifacts are stable as of this edition.

## Source

Protocol artifacts are compiled from source across the `pgs_governance` and `pgs_compiler` repositories. The workspace snapshot represents the last successful compilation. To see how artifacts are authored, see `pgs_governance/`. To understand the compilation process, see Chapter 4 — The Builder as Constitutional Compiler.
